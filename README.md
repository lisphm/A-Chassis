# Known Issues 🪧
*Solved issues will be marked with **SOLVED** for one update cycle*
1. Wheels glitch when approaching the car on spawn ❌
    - Setting network ownership on spawn _(Doesn't work)_
    - Disabling tire flex _(Doesn't work)_

2. Entire car shifts when steering on "New" steering type ❌
    - Set this to "Old" until fixed _(Temporary solution only, not recommended as it uses deprecated components)_
    - RigidityEnabled set to False _(Works, but with weak steering at high speed)_
    
3. Possible RPM jitter at low RPM ⚠️
4. Bike animation breaks layered clothing
