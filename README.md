# Known Issues 🪧
*Solved issues will be marked with **SOLVED** for one update cycle*
1. Wheels glitch when approaching the car on spawn ❌
    - Setting network ownership on spawn _(Doesn't work)_
    - Disabling tire flex _(Doesn't work)_

2. Entire car shifts when steering on "New" steering type ❌
    - Set this to "Old" until fixed _(Temporary solution only, not recommended as it uses deprecated components)_
    - RigidityEnabled set to False _(Works, but with weak steering at high speed)_
3. Front wheel "F" still flips around on spawn **(Solved)** ✔️
    - Change both `Attachment0` and `Attachment1` on "F" to `Vector.new(0, 180, 0)` _(Works)_
4. Possible RPM jitter at low RPM ⚠️
